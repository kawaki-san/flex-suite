                        <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">Corporate Information Technology Solutions began as a concept for an IT consulting firm in early 2008, with a complete Vision and Mission. The planning was in progress, and slowly developed throughout 2009. In August 2010 the logo was designed and the company was fully incorporated.</p>
                        <br /> <br />
                        <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">In September 2011, the core founders of CITS moved to work full time for the company, recruiting all other crucial positions. From this point, the company started to grow steadily getting a good reception by many businesses due to its specialization, the competencies of its people and due to the Information Technology Solutions requirement in the region</p>
                        <br /> <br />
                        <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg">CITS was established to help businesses use technology in increasing productivity and cutting cost while protecting their valuable information assets against threats and avoid potential risks. CITS combines the skills, commitment, specialization and experience of its staffs and consultants to help businesses best focus on what they do in a most productive way while securing their corporate information and infrastructure against malicious activities and unforeseen disruption due to man-made or natural events.</p>
